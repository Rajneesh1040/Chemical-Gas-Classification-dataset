## About Dataset

### Dataset Origin
This dataset has been preprocessed from the original dataset collected at a wind tunnel facility designed for chemical detection. It comprises 18,000 time-series recordings from six different locations within the wind tunnel. These recordings were obtained in response to ten high-priority chemical gaseous substances, resulting in a ten-class gas discrimination problem.
